Dear Visitor,

Please be welcome at my GitHub, where I am sharing my personal projects to show you my abilty to create reports using Power BI. My name is Adriana and I am fascinated by data analytics and how to implement simple automations to make corporate life easier. I started to work with data in 2018 when I was resposible for customers P&L. I had to dive deeper into it in 2019 when I joined Project Management department and took care of financial analysis for the whole department. That was the time when I was introduced to Power Platform, to Power BI especially. I have built an application in Power Apps to manage data of new ideas and improvements for the company, I have built a workflow to manage invoices for the customer in UK, banking area using Power Automate, I have been preparing financial analysis and reports of projects for CFO and the board. Later on when I changed the company I also changed the BI tool to SmartSheet which serves also to create reports. In the next job my game changer was learning better how to use Power Query. It helped me a lot in my work as each month i had to do the same report but adding next months data. And Power Query I actually got to know during one of Power BI training I participated. 
During my work for big corporations I noticed that it is more important for people to just have the work done than do it in an effective way. There was a tool, there was a training but people prefer to chose what they already know even thought it takes them 3 times more time. 

To see my reports you need to download the Power BI file and open it in youur Power BI desktop.
