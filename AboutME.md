Dear Visitor,

Please be welcome at my GitHub, where I am collecting my personal projects to show you my abilty to create reports using Power BI. My name is Adriana and I am fascinated by data analytics and how to implement simple automations to make corporate life easier. I started to work with data in 2018 when I was resposible for customers P&L. I had to dive deeper into it in 2019 when I joined Project Management department and took care of financial analysis. That was the time when i My first game changer was learning how to use Power Query. It helped me a lot in my work as each month i had to do the same report but adding next months data. And Power Query I actually got to know during one of Power BI training I participated.
