Dear Visitor,

Welcome to my GitHub! Here, I share my personal projects to showcase my ability to create reports using Power BI, a tool that fascinates me. My name is Adriana, and I am a dynamic Data Analyst and BI Developer with over five years of hands-on experience in transforming raw data into actionable insights. I excel in using Power BI and Power Query to create interactive reports that drive strategic decision-making.

In my last job, I led a team of five, crafting detailed analyses and reports using Power BI, Access, and Power Query. I also focused on budgeting, forecasting, and resource allocation, leveraging tools like Excel, Clarity, GPDM, and Cognos to optimize financial processes.

Previously, I worked as a Smartsheet developer, creating customized reports for global teams and providing comprehensive training sessions. At ISS Facility Services, I managed teams, conducted Project Management department audits, and spearheaded financial analysis and process automation projects, utilizing Power Platform (Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate) and SharePoint, which I shared with the CFO and the board.

I am always eager to learn and expand my technical skill set. Besides my knowledge of Microsoft tools, I am also honing my SQL skills. My educational background includes a Postgraduate Diploma in Quality Management, a Master’s in Clinical Psychology, and an Engineering Diploma in Management and Production Engineering. I am fluent in Polish and English, with additional proficiency in Portuguese and basic Italian.

I am a problem solver with a passion for innovation and process improvement. My unique combination of technical prowess, leadership experience, and educational achievements makes me an invaluable asset to any organization looking to leverage data for business growth.

If you’re looking for a dedicated and skilled Data Analyst who can elevate your data strategy, I am the professional you need.

To see my reports, please download the Power BI file and open it in your Power BI desktop.

Best regards,
Ada
